---

## 🔹 **Slides 29–30: Bass Model & “Crossing the Chasm”**

### **Bass Model**

  * **N** = potential market
  * **f(t)** = adoption rate over time

### **Crossing the Chasm (Geoffrey Moore)**

* Critical gap between early adopters and early majority.
* Many startups fail here due to **marketing misalignment**:

  * Visionaries want innovation and potential.
  * Pragmatists want proven success and reliability.

---

### 🔹 **Slides 17–18: New Product Pricing Strategies**

* Examples: Netflix, Disney+ used it to enter competitive streaming markets.

---

### 🔹 **Slides 20–23: Product Mix Pricing Strategies**

1. **Product Line Pricing**: Pricing different products in a line based on features and value.

4. **Product Bundle Pricing**: Combining products at a lower total price (e.g., fast food meals, software suites).

---

### 🔹 **Slide 28: Price Adjustment Strategies – Psychological Pricing**

* **Psychological Pricing**: Influences perception and behavior.

  * **Price-quality relationship**: Higher price = perceived better quality.
  * **Reference prices**: Mental benchmarks.
  * **Charm pricing**: \$9.99 feels cheaper than \$10.
  * **Threshold pricing**: Keep prices under psychological barriers (e.g., \$499 vs \$501).
  * **Price anchoring**: Show expensive option to make another seem cheaper.
  * **Decoy pricing**: Add a less attractive option to drive choice toward preferred one.

---

### 🔹 **Slides 29–31: Advanced Revenue Models**

#### **Freemium Model**

* Base product is free; premium version is paid.
* Reduces adoption barriers and targets small % of paying users.
* Related tactics: Free trial, ad-free versions, PAYW (Pay As You Wish).

#### **Transaction vs. Recurring Revenue**

* **Transaction**: One-time fees (e.g., implementation).
* **Recurring**: Subscriptions, licenses, usage-based models.

#### **Sales-led vs Product-led Growth**

* **Sales-led**: Human sales effort, relationship-building, demos.
* **Product-led**: The product drives adoption and growth (e.g., SaaS tools).

* **Purpose**: Channels **bridge time, place, and possession gaps** between producers and consumers, turning large-scale production into what customers want.
* **Why use intermediaries?**:

  * They **reduce the number of transactions** between producers and customers (see Figure 12.1).
  * They perform **key functions**:

    * **Information**: Gathering/distributing market intelligence.
    * **Promotion**: Communicating about the offer.
    * **Contact**: Finding prospective buyers.
    * **Matching**: Tailoring the offer (e.g., assembling, customizing).
    * **Negotiation**: Finalizing price and terms.
    * **Distribution**: Transporting/storing goods.
    * **Financing**: Offering credit and financial options.
    * **Risk-taking**: Absorbing risks.
* **Channel levels**: Can be direct (producer to customer) or include multiple intermediaries.
* **Types of flows in a channel**:

  * Product flow
  * Ownership flow
  * Payment flow
  * Information flow
  * Promotion flow

---

### **Slides 8–16: Channel Behavior and Organization**

* **Channel conflict**:

  * **Horizontal conflict**: Between firms at the same level (e.g., retailers).
  * **Vertical conflict**: Between different levels (e.g., franchisor and franchisee).
* **Vertical Marketing Systems (VMS)**:

  * VMS is a unified system where one member controls the others to improve efficiency and reduce conflict.
  * Types:

    1. **Corporate VMS**: One company owns all levels (e.g., Tesla owns its showrooms).
    2. **Contractual VMS**: Independent firms join through contracts (e.g., franchises like Planet Fitness).
    3. **Administered VMS**: One dominant party (like Apple or Walmart) dictates terms due to its size/power.
* **Horizontal Marketing System**:

  * Collaboration between companies at the same level to pursue a new opportunity (e.g., Best Buy + Amazon partnership).
* **Multichannel Distribution System** (see Figure 12.4):

  * Companies use more than one channel to reach different customer segments or markets (e.g., retail + online).

---

### **Slide 17: Channel Design Decisions**

* **Distribution strategies**:

  * **Intensive**: Maximize outlet availability (e.g., soft drinks).
  * **Exclusive**: Limited, high-end outlets (e.g., luxury cars).
  * **Selective**: A few qualified intermediaries (e.g., appliances).
* **Responsibility agreements** between producers and intermediaries:

  * Price policies, conditions of sale, territorial rights, and services offered.

---

### **Slide 18: Public Policy and Distribution Decisions**

* **Legal concerns**:

  * Avoid **exclusionary tactics** that prevent fair competition.
  * **Exclusive distribution**: One dealer per territory.
  * **Exclusive dealing**: Dealer can’t carry competitors.
  * **Exclusive territorial agreements**: Restrict dealer location/operation.
  * **Tying agreements**: Dealer must carry the full product line, not just individual products.
