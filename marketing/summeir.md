---

## 🧩 **Three Levels of a Product**

1. **Core Benefit** – What is the buyer really buying? (e.g., transportation for a car).
2. **Actual Product** – The tangible product (design, brand, features).
3. **Augmented Product** – Additional services and benefits (e.g., warranty, after-sales support).

🔗 *Example Video: [YouTube – Product Levels](https://youtu.be/msWiE1zCn58?si=1XYdX2lC9Vq8LYOE)*

---

* The quality of service **depends on interactions**, not just output.

---

## 🔖 **Brands and Branding Strategy**

### ➤ **Importance of Brands**

* Brands can be more valuable than physical assets.
* A strong brand creates trust and preference.

| **Product-Led (PLG)** | Product itself drives acquisition and engagement (ideal for self-service, easy-to-use products). |

---

## 🧲 **13. B2B Marketing Funnel**

**Key Roles & Progression:**

* **MDR (Marketing Development Rep)** → MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead)
* **SDR (Sales Development Rep)** → SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)

Here is a **detailed summary** of **Chapter 7: Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy – Creating Value for Target Customers** from the *Principles of Marketing* (19th Edition):

---

## 📘 **Overview**

Chapter 7 introduces the **STP model**—**Segmentation**, **Targeting**, and **Positioning**—which is used to build a customer value–driven marketing strategy.

---

## 🧭 **1. The Two Big Questions in Marketing**

1. **Which customers will we serve?**
   → *Segmentation* and *Targeting*
2. **How will we serve them?**
   → *Differentiation* and *Positioning*

---

## 📊 **2. Market Segmentation**

Segmenting means dividing a market into **smaller segments** with distinct needs, traits, or behaviors.

### 🔹 Segmenting **Consumer Markets**

#### ➤ **Geographic Segmentation**

* Dividing by region, city, neighborhood, etc.
* Companies adapt products/promotions locally.
* **Examples**:

  * Burger King's Whopper Detour (600 ft from McDonald's).
  * Domino’s customized menu for Indian markets.

#### ➤ **Demographic Segmentation**

* Age, gender, income, education, religion, ethnicity, etc.
* Easy to measure and often linked to behavior.
* **Examples**:

  * Nike offers distinct product lines by age/gender.
  * Different distribution channels based on income levels.

#### ➤ **Psychographic Segmentation**

* Social class, lifestyle, personality.
* **Example**:

  * L’Oréal campaign appeals to ambitious, professional women.
  * Data show companies with more women leaders perform better.

#### ➤ **Behavioral Segmentation**

* Based on **usage**, **benefits sought**, **loyalty**, **occasions**.
* Common segmentation types:

  * **User status**: first-timers, regulars, ex-users.
  * **Usage rate**: light, medium, heavy.
  * **Loyalty type**: switchers, loyalists, advocates.

#### ➤ **Multi-variable Segmentation**

* Combines geographic, demographic, lifestyle, behavioral data.
* **Examples**:

  * *Experian’s Mosaic*: 71 lifestyle segments.
  * *Acxiom’s Personicx*: creative cluster names like “Soccer and SUVs.”

---

### 🔹 Segmenting **Business Markets**

* Similar variables to consumer markets, plus:

  * **Operating characteristics**
  * **Purchasing approaches**
  * **Situational factors**
  * **Decision roles**

---

### 🔹 Segmenting **International Markets**

* By geography, economy, politics, legal systems, and culture.

---

### ✅ **Effective Segmentation Criteria**

1. **Measurable**
2. **Accessible**
3. **Substantial**
4. **Differentiable**
5. **Actionable**

---

## 🎯 **3. Market Targeting**

Once segments are identified, companies evaluate and select which to serve.

### 🔹 Evaluation Factors

* Segment size & growth
* Structural attractiveness (competitors, substitutes)
* Fit with company resources and goals

### 🔹 Targeting Strategies

| Strategy                    | Description                           | Pros                 | Cons                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Undifferentiated (mass)** | One offer to entire market            | Simple               | Misses specific needs    |
| **Differentiated**          | Separate offers for multiple segments | Increases sales      | More cost & complexity   |
| **Concentrated (niche)**    | Focus on one or few segments          | Efficient, effective | Risky if niche shrinks   |
| **Micromarketing**          | Tailored to individuals/local areas   | Highly personalized  | Expensive, hard to scale |

🔸 *Examples*:

* **Lenovo**: Solar-powered laptop for sustainability-conscious users.
* **Meta**: Different apps for different segments—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger.
* **Tesla**: Started with a niche luxury EV segment, now expanded.

---

## 🔄 **4. Differentiation and Positioning**

After selecting target customers, marketers decide **how to serve them better than competitors**.

### 🔹 Positioning

* The **place a product occupies in the mind** of the customer.
* It’s based on perceptions, not just features.
* **Example**:

  * *Spotify*: “Music for every mood”
  * *BMW*: “Ultimate Driving Machine” (performance + luxury)

### 🔹 Positioning Maps

* Visual tools to show how brands are perceived on key attributes (e.g., price vs. quality).

---

## 🧩 **5. Choosing a Positioning Strategy**

### 🔹 Competitive Advantage Sources

* Product
* Services
* People
* Channels
* Image

### 🔹 Criteria for Differentiation

* **Important**
* **Distinctive**
* **Superior**
* **Communicable**
* **Preemptive**
* **Affordable**
* **Profitable**

---

## 💬 **6. The Value Proposition**

This is the full set of benefits upon which a brand is positioned.

> **Positioning Statement Format:**
> “To \[target segment and need], our \[brand] is \[concept] that \[point of difference].”

**Example**:
"To health-conscious families, *Thrive Market* is a sustainable online grocery store that delivers organic and affordable essentials—good for both you and the planet."

---

## ✅ **Key Takeaways**

* STP = **Segmentation**, **Targeting**, **Positioning**—core to value-driven marketing.
* Segmentation should be multi-dimensional and precise.
* Targeting requires balancing profitability with social responsibility.
* Positioning is about shaping **customer perception**—not just product specs.

* Used to forecast **total adoption over time**.

### 🔹 Geoffrey Moore’s “Crossing the Chasm”

* **Takeoff**: The point where adoption accelerates.

Here is a **detailed summary** of **Chapters 10–11: Pricing – Understanding and Capturing Customer Value** from the *Principles of Marketing* (19th Edition):

---

## 💰 **1. What Is Price?**

* Price is the amount of money charged for a product or service.
* More broadly, it’s the **sum of all the values** that customers give up to gain a product’s benefits.
* Pricing is **highly flexible** and a critical **strategic tool** for creating value and building relationships.

---

## 🎯 **2. Major Pricing Strategies**

### 🔹 Value-Based Pricing

* Starts with **customer perception of value**, not seller cost.
* Good-value pricing = Right mix of **quality, service, and fair price** (e.g., Walmart’s EDLP).
* **High-low pricing**: Frequent discounts and promotions (e.g., department stores).

### 🔹 Cost-Based Pricing

* Based on production costs + markup.
* Less customer-focused.

### 🔹 Competition-Based Pricing

* Sets price based on **competitors’ prices and strategies**.
* Example: Caterpillar charges more but offers better lifetime value.

---

## 🧠 **3. Value-Added Pricing**

* Adds services/features to differentiate and justify higher prices.
* Example: Porsche Drive’s luxury car subscription service.

---

## 🧩 **4. Internal & External Factors Affecting Pricing**

* **Marketing strategy & objectives**
* **Brand positioning**: Premium vs. budget
* **Target costing**: Start with ideal price, then design a cost structure to support it.

---

## 🚀 **5. New Product Pricing Strategies**

### 🔹 Market-Skimming Pricing

* **High initial price** to "skim" maximum revenue.
* Best when:

  * Product has unique value
  * Limited competition
* **Example**: Tesla launched luxury EVs at high prices to build brand prestige.

### 🔹 Market-Penetration Pricing

* **Low initial price** to gain quick adoption and market share.
* Good for:

  * Price-sensitive markets
  * Discouraging competition
* **Examples**: Netflix, Disney+
