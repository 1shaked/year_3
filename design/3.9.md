## **3.9 Visualization and Analysis Processes**

### ðŸ”¹ **Measurement Scales of Variables:**

| Variable                                                    | Measurement Scale                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `avg_salary`, `max_salary`, `med_salary`                    | **Ratio** (numeric, continuous)  |
| `job_state`, `industry`, `company name`, `experience level` | **Nominal** (categorical)        |
| `seniority`, `job type`, `work type`                        | **Ordinal** (ordered categories) |
| `remote_flag` (derived from same\_state or posting domain)  | **Binary / Nominal**             |

### ðŸ”¹ **Why We Chose These Visualizations:**

| Visualization                      | Type              | Why This Was Chosen                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Best & Worst Cities**            | Bar Chart         | Compares `max_salary` easily across locations â€” best for extremes |
| **Experience Avg Salary (Bubble)** | Packed Bubbles    | Intuitively shows salary magnitude and experience clusters        |
| **Best Companies**                 | Stacked Bar Chart | Shows both avg salary and work type (full-time vs. contract)      |
| **Best Industries**                | Bar Chart + Color | Highlights both salary and industry distribution                  |
| **Best Specialty**                 | Treemap           | Easily displays job posting volume by specialty                   |
| **Best Websites**                  | Bar Chart         | Compares `med_salary` and `remote job count` (via color gradient) |

### ðŸ”¹ **UI/UX & Design Principles Used:**

* **Consistency & Simplicity:** All graphs are clearly titled and use consistent axis formatting (e.g., \$ salary)
* **Color Encoding:** Used for category differentiation (e.g., work type, experience level) and quantitative comparison (e.g., remote count via color gradient)
* **Interaction:** User can filter by **top N**, **work type**, **experience level**, **domain**, and drill into **industry** or **location**
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Layout emphasizes key decisions (salary, remote, experience) at a glance

### ðŸ”¹ Summary of What Is Represented:

* Explore where the highest-paying jobs are located
* Compare experience levels and salaries
* Evaluate companies and websites worth applying through
* Understand which sectors or specialties are growing
