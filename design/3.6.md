# **Fact Table: FactJobPostings**

* **Granularity**: 1 row per unique job posting (`job_posting_id`).
* **History**: Point-in-time snapshot of when the job was posted (non-historical). If postings are updated over time (e.g., salary changes), a **slowly changing fact** or **temporal snapshot** model is needed.

# **Bridge Tables (Company)**

These link dimensions but donâ€™t store facts (measures). They are static unless your data tracks changes (e.g., a company drops a benefit).

| Table               | Granularity                      | History Type       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `CompanyIndustry`   | 1 row per company per industry   | Static or snapshot |
| `CompanySpeciality` | 1 row per company per speciality | Static or snapshot |
| `CompanyBenefit`    | 1 row per company per benefit    | Static or snapshot |

To handle changes over time (e.g., a company changing its benefits), you'd create **temporal bridge tables** with `start_date`, `end_date`.
