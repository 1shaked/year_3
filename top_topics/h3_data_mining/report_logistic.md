## üßæ Logistic Regression Classifier ‚Äì Report

### 1. **Objective**

This section evaluates a **Logistic Regression** model applied to classify companies by their financial strength using normalized financial ratios.

* **Class 0**: Financially Weak
* **Class 1**: Financially Strong

---

### 2. **Model Configuration**

* **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
* **Solver**: lbfgs
* **Max Iterations**: 1000
* **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler applied to all input features
* **Training/Testing Split**: 80/20 stratified split

### 3. **Performance Evaluation**

#### üìä Classification Report

| Class          | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
| -------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| **0 (Weak)**   | 0.68      | 0.40   | 0.51     | 57      |
| **1 (Strong)** | 0.79      | 0.92   | 0.85     | 140     |

* **Accuracy**: **77.2%**
* **Macro Avg F1-score**: 0.68
* **Weighted Avg F1-score**: 0.75

#### üìå Confusion Matrix

|                   | Predicted Weak | Predicted Strong |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Actual Weak**   | 23             | 34               |
| **Actual Strong** | 11             | 129              |

The model:

* Correctly classified **129 out of 140 strong companies**
* Correctly identified only **23 out of 57 weak companies**, indicating moderate difficulty in detecting the minority class

---

### 4. **ROC Curve Analysis**

* **AUC Score**: **0.79**

*Interpretation*: The ROC curve rises well above the diagonal baseline, indicating that the model has good discriminatory ability between weak and strong companies based on predicted probabilities.

---

### 5. **Conclusion**

Logistic Regression performs well overall, with **solid accuracy and excellent recall for strong companies (92%)**. However, it struggles to detect financially weak companies, achieving only **40% recall** for that class. This limits its utility in risk-sensitive applications where missing weak companies is costly.

#### ‚úÖ Strengths:

* Well-calibrated predicted probabilities (AUC = 0.79)
* Strong performance for majority class

#### ‚ùå Weaknesses:

* Poor recall and F1-score for the weak class (Class 0)
* Moderate class imbalance affects sensitivity
